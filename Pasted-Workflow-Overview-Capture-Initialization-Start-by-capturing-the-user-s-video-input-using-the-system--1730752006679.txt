Workflow Overview
Capture Initialization
Start by capturing the user's video input using the system's webcam.
Configure NVIDIA's CUDA for accelerated processing if the local machine has compatible hardware. Ensure the NVIDIA drivers and CUDA Toolkit are properly installed.
Feature Detection and Calibration
Use MediaPipe with real-time processing capabilities offered by TensorFlow or PyTorch to detect facial, body, and hand landmarks.
Execute a calibration routine:
Voice Calibration: Record a sample of the user speaking for voice pitch and tone matching.
Pose Calibration: Ask the user to perform specific movements, like side-to-side and full body rotations, to accurately capture their unique motion signature.
Provide visual cues and guidance onscreen during this process.
Include a timer on the screen to show remaining calibration time.
Progress Monitoring
Implement a progress bar to show the percentage of completion for different calibration and rendering phases.
For calibration: Update the progress bar incrementally as each calibration step (voice, body, full rotation) is completed.
Display current calibration step and estimated time remaining using smooth animations and text labels.
3D Avatar Rendering
Utilize SMPL models for generating dynamic 3D body geometry.
Render high-quality avatars using Three.js or Unity with NVIDIA's TensorRT to maximize the rendering performance.
Use enhanced lighting and shading techniques for realism.
Optionally, leverage Realtime NVIDIA RTX global illumination.
Real-time Synchronization and Streaming
Integrate OBS via the NDI plugin to provide continuous video output of the rendered avatar.
Enable users to stream through platforms such as Zoom by setting OBS as a virtual camera.
Maintain synchronized audio streams by integrating OpenAL or similar libraries.
Feedback Loop and Control
Implement basic voice command recognition using pre-trained Google Speech APIs for minor controls and adjustments.
Handle frequent tasks and controls via a simple Electron or React front-end interface, allowing easy refresh, pose change, or background modifications.
Final Configuration and Testing
Perform a final test to check all systems are working in harmony.
Log errors, process updates, and configuration changes using logging libraries such as Logstash.
Ask users to provide feedback for further refinement.
Enhancements from Previous Suggestions
Security and Privacy: Include OAuth 2.0 for any cloud API usage.
Dynamic Overlays in OBS: Create customizable visual elements shown during streams.
Optimization: NVIDIA TensorRT or Intel OpenVINO for improving rendering smoothly.
User Interface: Develop using Electron to enhance user interaction with configuration and real-time adjustments
